# [Selector: Interactive Web Interface for Chemical Subset Selection](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/JpL7n5Ji)

# Intro

Dear contributors of QC-Devs, 

My name is Jun Xia. I have been selected as a GSoC contributor for our Selector package this year (2024) . I will work on creating a web interface for our Selector package using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), and I will leverage [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to deploy the complete application on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/).

Currently, our Selector package is a complete backend application, which makes it difficult for scientists or scholars with minimal coding experience to use our tool. Fortunately, Streamlit simplifies the process of creating interfaces for data-based tools, and I am excited to learn and use this new Python framework for the first time in a real-world application.

You can find the most updated details in the progress log below. (I can be a bit chatty, but I believe this helps me stay motivated and on track with our timeline.) You can also check out our [weekly meeting notes](https://github.com/theochem/Selector/discussions) in the discussion panel.

I am open to suggestions and ideas, so feel free to @ me below to discuss your thoughts.

I am looking forward to a great summer with our project!
